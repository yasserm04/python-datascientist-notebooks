    "## 2.1 The Document-Term Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, we construct a synthetic representation of our corpus as a bag of words, where words are sampled more or less frequently depending on their appearance frequency. This is, of course, a simplified representation of reality: word sequences are not just random independent words.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, before addressing those limitations, we should complete the bag-of-words approach. The most characteristic representation of this paradigm is the document-term matrix, mainly used to compare corpora. It involves creating a matrix where each document is represented by the presence or absence of terms in our corpus. The idea is to count how often words (terms, in columns) appear in each sentence or phrase (documents, in rows). This matrix then becomes a numerical representation of the text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a corpus made up of the following three sentences:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The practice of knitting and crocheting\n",
    "-   Passing on the passion for stamps\n",
    "-   Living off one’s passion”\n",
    "\n",
    "The corresponding document-term matrix is:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Sentence | and | crocheting | for | knitting | living | of | one’s | on | passion | passing | practice | stamps | the |\n",
    "|------------------|:--:|:----:|:--:|:----:|:---:|:-:|:--:|:-:|:---:|:----:|:----:|:---:|:--:|\n",
    "| The practice of knitting and crocheting | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| Passing on the passion for stamps | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |\n",
    "| Living off one’s passion | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Each sentence in the corpus is associated with a numeric vector. For instance,\n",
    "the sentence *“La pratique du tricot et du crochet”*, which is meaningless to a machine on its own, becomes a numeric vector it can interpret: `[1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]`. This numeric vector is a *sparse* representation of language, since each document (row) will only contain a small portion of the total vocabulary (all columns). Words that do not appear in a document are represented as zeros, hence a *sparse* vector. As we’ll see later, this numeric representation is very different from modern *embedding* approaches, which are based on dense representations.\n",

    "Different documents can then be compared based on these measures. This is one of the methods used by search engines, although the most advanced ones rely on far more sophisticated approaches. The [tf-idf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) metric (*term frequency–inverse document frequency*)\n",

    "\n",
    "-   The `idf` component computes a function that decreases with the frequency of the term across the entire document set (or corpus).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The first part (*term frequency*, TF) is the frequency of occurrence of term $t$ in document $d$. There are normalization strategies available to avoid biasing the score in favor of longer documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{tf}(t, d) = \\frac{f_{t,d}}{\\sum_{t' \\in d} f_{t',d}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $f_{t,d}$ is the raw count of how many times term $t$ appears in document $d$, and the denominator is the total number of terms in document $d$.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The second part (*inverse document frequency*, IDF) measures the rarity—or conversely, the commonness—of a term across the corpus. If $N$ is the total number of documents in the corpus $D$, this part of the metric is given by\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The denominator $( |\\{d \\in D : t \\in d\\}| )$ corresponds to the number of documents in which the term $t$ appears. The rarer the word, the more its presence in a document is given additional weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many search engines use this logic to find the most relevant documents in response to a search query. One notable example is [`ElasticSearch`](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch), the software used to implement powerful search engines. To rank the most relevant documents for a given search term, it uses the [BM25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25) distance metric, which is a more advanced version of the TF-IDF measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.3 Example\n",

    "## 4.2 Text Data Classification: The `Fasttext` Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "`Fasttext` is a single-layer neural network developed by Meta in 2016 for text classification and language modeling. As we will see, this model serves as a bridge to more refined forms of language modeling, although `Fasttext` remains far simpler than large language models (LLMs). One of the main use cases of `Fasttext` is supervised text classification: determining a text’s category. For example, identifying whether a song’s lyrics belong to the rap or rock genre. This is a supervised model because it learns to recognize *features*—in this case, pieces of text—that lead to good prediction performance on both training and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of a *feature* might seem odd for text data, which is inherently unstructured. For structured data, as discussed in the [modeling section](../../content/course/modelisation/index.qmd), the approach was straightforward: features were observed variables, and the classification algorithm identified the best combination to predict the label. With text data, we must build features from the text itself—turning unstructured data into structured form. This is where the concepts we’ve covered so far come into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "`FastText` uses a *“bag of n-grams”* approach. It considers that features are derived not only from words in the corpus but also from multiple levels of n-grams. The general architecture of `FastText` looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InseeFrLab/formation-mlops/main/slides/img/diag-fasttext.png\" alt=\"Diagram of FastText architecture\" />\n",
    "<figcaption aria-hidden=\"true\">Diagram of <code>FastText</code> architecture</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "What interests us here is the left side of the diagram—*“feature extraction”*—since the *embedding* part relates to concepts we will cover in upcoming chapters. In the figure’s example, the text *“Business engineering and services”* is tokenized into words as we’ve seen earlier. But `Fasttext` also creates multiple levels of n-grams. For instance, it generates word bigrams: *“Business engineering”*, *“engineering and”*, *“and services”*; and also character four-grams like *“busi”*, *“usin”*, and *“sine”*. Then, `Fasttext` transforms all these items into numeric vectors. Unlike the term frequency representations we’ve seen, these vectors are not based on corpus frequency (as in document-term matrices) but are word embeddings. We’ll explore this concept in future chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Fasttext` is widely used in public statistics, as many textual data sources need to be classified into aggregated nomenclatures."
