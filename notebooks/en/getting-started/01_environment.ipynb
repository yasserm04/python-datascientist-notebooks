    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The richness of *open-source* languages comes from the ability\n",
    "to use *packages*\n",
    "developed by specialists. `Python` is particularly\n",
    "well-endowed in this area. To caricature, it is sometimes said\n",
    "that `Python` is the second-best language for all tasks, which makes it the best language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, the malleability of `Python` means that it can be\n",
    "approached in very different ways\n",
    "depending on whether you are a *SysAdmin*, a web developer, or a\n",
    "*data scientist*. It is this latter profile that will interest us here.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this richness poses a challenge when starting to\n",
    "learn `Python` or reusing code\n",
    "written by others. Proprietary statistical\n",
    "languages operate in a *top-down* model, where, once a license is acquired,\n",
    "you simply install the software and follow the documentation provided by\n",
    "the developing company to proceed. In *open source* languages, the approach is more *bottom up*: the ecosystem is enriched by contributions and documentation from various sources. Several ways of doing the same thing coexist, and it is part of the work to take the time to choose the best approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are primarily two ways to use `Python` for *data science*[1]:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Local installation**: [Install the `Python` software](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your machine, configure a suitable environment (usually via [`Anaconda`](https://www.anaconda.com/download)), and use a development tool, such as [`Jupyter`](https://jupyter.org/) or [`VSCode`](https://code.visualstudio.com/), to write and execute `Python` code. We will revisit these three levels of abstraction in the next section.\n",
    "2.  **Using an online environment**: Access a preconfigured `Python` environment via your browser, hosted on a remote machine. This machine will execute the code you edit from your browser. This method is particularly recommended for beginners or for those who do not want to deal with system configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second approach is related to *cloud* services. In the context of this course, as will be explained later, we offer two solutions: `SSPCloud`, a *cloud* developed by the French administration and provided free of charge to students, researchers, and public officials, or `Google Colab`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two methods are briefly described below. The local installation method is presented to introduce useful concepts but is not detailed as it can be complex and prone to configuration issues. If you choose this route, be prepared to encounter technical difficulties and sometimes obscure configurations, often requiring tedious searches to resolve problems that you would probably not have encountered in an online environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Ingredients for a functional `Python` environment\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, using `Python` locally for data science relies on three main elements: the `Python` interpreter, a virtual environment, and an integrated development environment (IDE). Each of these components plays a complementary role in the development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 `Python` Interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "This refers to the programming language itself. Installing `Python` on your machine is the essential first step, as it provides the interpreter needed to run your `Python` code. At this stage, it is only the base language and a command-line tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Illustration**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> If you have access to a command line in an environment where `Python` is available and properly configured (including being added to the [`PATH`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable#%3CPATH%3E_for_executable_locations)), you can already run `Python` through the command line[2]\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ``` python\n",
    "> python --version\n",
    "> python -c \"print(3+3)\"\n",
    "> echo \"print(3+3)\" > example.py && python example.py && rm example.py\n",
    "> ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Line 3  \n",
    "> An example of creating a file `example.py` from the command line and using it from the command line. Since creating files from the command line is not a realistic working mode, we will explain how to create files using a text editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 `Python` Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Python` language is built, like other open-source languages, with a basic core and additional packages. It is these packages that form the rich and dynamic ecosystem of `Python`, making it such a comfortable language.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Python` is an open-source language, which means that anyone can offer their code for reuse in the form of a package. There are platforms that centralize community packages, with the main one in the `Python` ecosystem being [`PyPI`](https://pypi.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "An environment refers to the collection of packages available to `Python` for performing specific tasks. `Python` is not installed with all the packages available on [`PyPI`](https://pypi.org/), so it is up to you to enrich your environment by installing new packages as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your `Python` is correctly configured, you can install new packages using `pip install`[3]. We will use many packages in this course, so this command will come up regularly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once installed, a script must declare a package before using it (otherwise `Python` won’t know where to find specific functions). This is the purpose of the `import` command. For example, `import pandas as pd` allows you to use the `Pandas` package (provided it is already installed).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Illustration**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Here is an illustration of how package management works in `Python`\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ``` python\n",
    "> python -c \"import geopandas as gpd\"\n",
    "> pip install geopandas\n",
    "> python -c \"import geopandas as gpd ; print(gpd.GeoDataFrame)\"\n",
    "> ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Line 1  \n",
    "> This should cause an error if `GeoPandas` is not installed\n",
    "> `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'geopandas'`\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Line 3  \n",
    "> The error should be gone\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Important**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> It is discouraged to use global imports like `from pkg import *`. For example, consider two modules that provide a `sqrt` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "# Don't do that please !\n",
    "from numpy import *\n",
    "from math import *\n",
    "sqrt([4, 3])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Global imports load all functions and variables from the `numpy` and `math` modules into the global namespace, which can lead to naming conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, this can lead to unpredictable results, as if the implementations differ, how do you know whether it’s the `numpy` or `math` package function that was used? Here, it will be the `math` package function, imported last, which will cause an error: the `math` module only handles integers, not vectors, unlike `numpy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, it makes the code less readable, as it becomes difficult to know where each function or variable used comes from, complicating maintenance and debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is therefore preferable to import only the necessary functions or use explicit aliases, such as `import numpy as np` and `import math`, to avoid these issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "from math import sqrt\n",
    "\n",
    "np.sqrt([3,4])\n",
    "sqrt(3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.1 Development environments and notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `Python` via the command line is fundamental in the application world. However, it’s impractical to write your code directly in the command line on a daily basis. Fortunately, there are suitable editors known as IDEs. These are software that provide a convenient interface for writing and executing your code. They offer features to simplify code reading and writing: syntax highlighting, autocompletion, debugging, formal code quality diagnostics, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Jupyter` notebooks[4] offer an interactive interface that allows you to write `Python` code, test it, and see the result below the instruction rather than in a separate console. `Jupyter` notebooks are essential in the fields of data science and education and research because they greatly simplify exploration and experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "They allow you to combine text in `Markdown` format (a lighter markup text format than `HTML` or $\\LaTeX$), `Python` code, and `HTML` code for visualizations and animations in a single document.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, `Jupyter` was the only software offering these interactive features. Now, there are other ways to benefit from notebook advantages while having an IDE with more comprehensive features than `Jupyter`. For this reason, as of 2024, it is more practical to use `VSCode`, a general-purpose code editor but offering excellent features in `Python`, than `Jupyter`. For more information on using notebooks in VSCode, refer to the [official documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Using notebooks in the context of this course\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to learn `Python` or notebooks is through practice, so all chapters of this course will be executable in notebook format. The following buttons allow you to open this chapter in notebook format in different environments:\n",

    "# 5. How to solve errors?\n",
    "\n",
    "Encountering errors is completely natural and expected when learning (and even after!) a programming language. Resolving these errors is a great opportunity to understand how the language works and to become self-sufficient in its use. Here is a suggested sequence of steps to follow (in this order) to resolve an error:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Read the *logs* carefully**, i.e., the outputs returned by `Python` in case of an error. Often, they are informative and may contain the answer directly.\n",
    "2.  **Search on the internet** (preferably in English and on `Google`). For example, providing the error name and part of the informative error message returned by `Python` usually helps to orient the search results towards what you are looking for.\n",
    "3.  Often, the **search will lead you to the [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) forum**, which is designed for this purpose. If you really can’t find the answer to your problem, you can post on `Stackoverflow` by detailing the problem encountered so that forum users can reproduce it and find a solution.\n",
    "4.  **Official documentation** (of `Python` and various packages) is often a bit dry but generally exhaustive. It helps to understand how to use the various objects. For example, for functions: what they expect as input, parameters and their types, what they return as output, etc.\n",
    "5.  Code assistant AIs (`ChatGPT`, `Github Copilot`) can be very helpful. By providing them with appropriate instructions and verifying the generated code to avoid hallucinations, you can save a lot of time with these tools.\n",

    "The rich and thriving `Python` ecosystem means you must stay attentive to its developments to avoid becoming outdated. While with monolithic languages like `SAS` or `Stata` one could rely solely on official documentation without ongoing technical monitoring, this is not feasible with `Python` or `R`. This course itself is continuously evolving, which is quite demanding 😅, to keep up with the ecosystem changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Social networks like `LinkedIn` or `X`, and content aggregators like `Medium` or `Towards Data Science`, offer posts of varying quality, but maintaining continuous technical monitoring on these topics is not useless: over time, it can help identify new trends. The site `Real Python` generally provides very good posts, comprehensive and educational. `Github` can also be useful for technical monitoring: by looking at trending projects, you can see the trends that will emerge soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding printed books, some are of very high quality. However, it is important to pay attention to their update dates: the rapid pace of some elements of the ecosystem can render them outdated very quickly. It is generally more useful to have a recent but non-exhaustive post than a complete but outdated book.\n",
