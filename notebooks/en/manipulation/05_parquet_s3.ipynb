However, no overview of data access methods would be complete without mentioning a relatively recent addition to the data ecosystem: the `Parquet` data format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to its technical advantages - specifically designed for analytical workloads - and its seamless integration with Python, `Parquet` is becoming increasingly essential. It has, in fact, become a key component of modern cloud infrastructures, which have emerged since the mid-2010s as the standard environment for data science workflows.[1]\n",

    "Before exploring the advantages of the `Parquet` format, it is helpful to briefly review how data is stored and made accessible to a processing language like `Python`[2].\n",
    "\n",
    "Two main approaches coexist: **file-based storage** and **relational database storage**. The key distinction between these paradigms lies in how access to data is structured and managed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 File-Based Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.1 Flat Files\n",
    "\n",
    "In a flat file, data is organized in a linear fashion, with values typically separated by a delimiter such as a comma, semicolon, or tab. Here’s a simple example using a `.csv` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` raw\n",

    "\n",
    "These are referred to as **flat files** because all the records related to a given observation are stored sequentially, without any hierarchical structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.2 Hierarchical files\n",
    "\n",
    "Other formats, such as `JSON`, structure data in a hierarchical way:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` json\n",
    "[\n",
    "  {\n",
    "    \"nom\": \"Astérix\"\n",

    "\n",
    "> **Caution**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The difference between a `.csv` file and a `JSON` file lies not only in their format but also in their underlying logic of data storage.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> `JSON` is a non-tabular format that offers greater flexibility: it allows the structure of the data to evolve over time without requiring previous entries to be modified or recompiled. This makes it particularly well-suited for dynamic data collection environments, such as APIs.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> For instance, a website that begins collecting a new piece of information doesn’t need to retroactively update all prior records. It can simply add the new field to the relevant entries—omitting it from others where the information wasn’t collected.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> It is then up to the query tool—such as `Python` or another platform—to reconcile and link data across these differing structures.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This flexible approach underpins many `NoSQL` databases (like `ElasticSearch`), which play a central role in the *big data* ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.3 Data split across multiple files\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common for a single observation to be distributed across multiple files in different formats. In geomatics, for example, geographic boundaries are often stored separately from the data that gives them context:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   In some cases, everything is bundled into a single file that contains both the geographic shapes and the associated attribute values. This is the approach used by formats like `GeoJSON`;\n",
    "-   In other cases, the data is split across several files, and reading the full information - geographic shapes, data for each zone, projection system, etc. - requires combining them. This is the case with the `Shapefile` format.\n",
    "\n",
    "When data is distributed across multiple files, this is up to the processing tool (e.g., `Python`) to perform the necessary joins and link the information together.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.4 The role of the *file system*\n",
    "\n",
    "The **file system** enables the computer to locate files physically on the disk. It plays a central role in file management, handling file naming, folder hierarchy, and access permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Storing Data in a Database\n",
    "\n",
    "The logic behind databases differs fundamentally and is more systematic in nature. A **relational database** is managed by a **Database Management System (DBMS)**, which provides capabilities for:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   storing coherent datasets;\n",
    "-   performing updates (insertions, deletions, modifications);\n",
    "-   controlling access (user permissions, query types, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is organized into **tables** connected by **relationships**, often structured according to a **star schema**:\n",
    "\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "The software managing the database links these tables together using `SQL` queries. One of the most powerful and widely used systems for this purpose is [`PostgreSQL`](https://www.postgresql.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "`Python` can interact with databases by issuing SQL queries. Historically, packages such as [`sqlalchemy`](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) and [`psycopg2`](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/) have been standard tools for communicating with `PostgreSQL` databases, enabling both reading and updating operations. More recently, [`DuckDB`](https://duckdb.org/) has emerged as a lightweight and user-friendly alternative for querying relational data, and it will be discussed again in the context of the `Parquet` format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why File-Based Storage is gaining popularity\n",
    "\n",
    "The increasing popularity of file-based storage in the data science ecosystem is due to a number of technical and practical advantages that make it well-suited for modern analytical workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Files are generally more lightweight and easier to manage than databases. They do not require the installation or maintenance of specialized software; a basic file system, available on every operating system, is sufficient for accessing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading a file in `Python` simply involves using a library such as `Pandas`. In contrast, interacting with a database typically requires:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   installing and configuring a DBMS (e.g., `PostgreSQL`, `MySQL`);\n",
    "-   managing network connections;\n",
    "-   relying on libraries such as `sqlalchemy` or `psycopg2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This additional complexity makes file-based workflows more flexible and faster for exploratory tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this simplicity comes with limitations. File-based systems generally lack fine-grained access control. For instance, preventing a user from modifying or deleting a file is difficult without duplicating it and working from a copy. This represents a constraint in multi-user environments, although cloud-based storage solutions — particularly `S3` technology, which will be addressed later — offer effective remedies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary reason why files are often preferred over DBMSs lies in the nature of the operations being performed. Relational databases are particularly well-suited for contexts involving frequent updates or complex operations on structured data — a typical **application logic**, in which data is continuously evolving (through insertions, updates, or deletions).\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, in **analytical** contexts, the focus is on reading and temporarily manipulating data without altering the original source. The objective is to query, aggregate, and filter — not to persist changes. In such scenarios, files (especially when stored in optimized formats like `Parquet`) are ideal: they offer fast read times, high portability, and eliminate the overhead associated with running a full database engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. The `Parquet` format\n",
    "\n",
    "The `CSV` format has long been popular for its simplicity:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   It is **human-readable** (any text editor can open it);\n",
    "-   It relies on a **simple tabular structure**, well-suited for many analytical situations;\n",
    "-   It is **universal** and interoperable, as it is not tied to any specific software.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this simplicity comes at a cost. Several limitations of the `CSV` format have led to the emergence of more efficient formats for data analysis, such as `Parquet`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 Limitations of the `CSV` format\n",
    "\n",
    "CSV is a **heavy** format:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   It is not compressed, increasing its disk size;\n",
    "-   All data is stored as raw text. Data type optimization (integer, float, string, etc.) is deferred to the importing library (like `Pandas`), which must **scan the data** at load time—slowing down performance and increasing error risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "CSV is **row-oriented**:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   To access a specific column, every **row must be read**, and the relevant column extracted;\n",
    "-   This model performs poorly when only a **subset of columns** is needed—a common case in data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "CSV is **expensive to modify**:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Adding a column or inserting intermediate data requires **rewriting the entire file**. For example, adding a `hair` column would mean generating a new version of the file:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` raw\n",
    "    name ; hair ; profession\n",
    "    Asterix ; blond ; \n",
    "    Obelix ; redhead ; Menhir sculptor\n",
    "    Assurancetourix ; blond ; Bard\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **About proprietary formats**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Most data science tools offer their own serialization formats:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> -   `.pickle` for `Python`,  \n",
    "> -   `.rda` or `.RData` for `R`,  \n",
    "> -   `.dta` for `Stata`,  \n",
    "> -   `.sas7bdat` for `SAS`.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> However, these formats are **proprietary** or **tightly coupled to one language**, which raises interoperability issues. For example, `Python` cannot natively read `.sas7bdat`. Even when third-party libraries exist, the lack of official documentation makes support unreliable.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In this regard, despite its limitations, `.csv` remains popular for its universality. But the `Parquet` format offers both this portability and significantly better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 The Rise of the `Parquet` Format\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these limitations, the `Parquet` format—developed as an [Apache open-source project](https://parquet.apache.org/) offers a radically different approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its key characteristic: it is **column-oriented**. Unlike CSVs, data for each column is stored **separately**. This allows:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   loading only the columns relevant for analysis;\n",
    "-   more efficient data compression;\n",
    "-   significantly faster selective queries.\n",

    "## 2.4 Reading a `Parquet` file in `Python`: example\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many libraries that integrate well with the `Parquet` format, but the two most important to know are `PyArrow` and `DuckDB`. These libraries were previously mentioned as alternatives to `Pandas` for handling larger-than-memory datasets. They are often used to perform heavy initial operations before converting the results into a lightweight `pd.DataFrame` for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [`PyArrow`](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/) library enables efficient reading and writing of `Parquet` files by taking advantage of their columnar structure[1]. It operates on a `pyarrow.Table` object, which—after processing—can be converted to a `Pandas` `DataFrame` to leverage the broader capabilities of the `Pandas` ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [`DuckDB`](https://duckdb.org/docs/api/python/) library allows you to query `Parquet` files directly using `SQL`, without loading the entire file into memory. In essence, it brings the database philosophy (structured queries via SQL) to file-based storage. The results of such queries can also be converted into a `Pandas` `DataFrame`, combining the convenience of `Pandas` with the efficiency of an embedded SQL engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lesser-known but valuable feature of `DuckDB` is its ability to perform SQL queries directly on a `Pandas` `DataFrame`. This can be especially useful when `Pandas` syntax becomes verbose or cumbersome—for example, when computing a new column based on grouped statistics, where SQL expressions can be more concise and readable.\n",

    "In this practical section, we will explore how to use the `Parquet` format as efficiently as possible. To compare different data formats and access strategies, we will **measure and compare the execution time and memory usage of a standard query**. We will begin with a lightweight example that compares the performance of reading data in `CSV` versus `Parquet` format.\n",

    "To do so, we will first retrieve a dataset in `Parquet` format. We suggest using the detailed and anonymized French population census data, which contains approximately 20 million rows and 80 columns. The code to download and access this dataset is provided below."

    "# 3. Data in the *Cloud*\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud storage, in the context of data science, follows the same principle as services like `Dropbox` or `Google Drive`: users can access remote files as if they were stored locally on their machines[1]. In other words, for a `Python` user, **working with cloud-stored files can feel exactly the same** as working with local files.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, unlike a local path such as `My Documents/mysuperfile`, the files are not physically stored on the user’s computer. They are hosted on a remote server, and every operation—reading or writing—relies on a network connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.1 Why Not Use `Dropbox` or `Google Drive`?\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite their similarities, services like `Dropbox` or `Google Drive` are not intended for large-scale data storage and processing. For data-intensive use cases, it is strongly recommended to rely on dedicated storage technologies (see [the production deployment course](https://ensae-reproductibilite.github.io/website/chapters/big-data.html)).\n",
    "\n",
    "All major cloud providers—AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure—rely on a common principle: **object storage**, often implemented through `S3`-compatible systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why leading cloud platforms offer specialized storage services, typically based on object storage, with `S3` (Simple Storage Service) being the most widely used and recognized standard.\n",

    "`S3` (Simple Storage Service), developed by Amazon, has become the de facto standard for cloud-based storage. It is:\n",

    "## 3.4 Practical Case: Storing Your Project’s Data on SSP Cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "A key criterion for evaluating `Python` projects is **reproducibility**—the ability to obtain the same results using the same input data and code. Whenever possible, your final submission should begin with the raw data used as input for your project. If the source files are publicly available via a URL, the ideal approach is to import them directly at the start of your project (see the [Pandas lab](../../content/manipulation/02_pandas_suite.qmd) for an example of such an import using `Pandas`).\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, this is not always feasible. Your data may not be publicly accessible, or it might come in complex formats that require preprocessing before it can be used in standard workflows. In other cases, your dataset may be the result of an automated retrieval process—such as through an [API](../../content/manipulation/04c_API_TP.qmd) or [web scraping](../../content/manipulation/04a_webscraping_TP.qmd)—which can be time-consuming to reproduce. Moreover, since websites frequently change over time, it is often better to “freeze” the data once collected. Similarly, even if you are not storing raw data, you may want to preserve trained models, as the training process can also be resource-intensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all of these situations, you need a reliable way to store data or models. **Your `Git` repository is not the appropriate place to store large files.** A well-structured `Python` project follows a modular design: it separates code (versioned with `Git`), configuration elements (such as API tokens, which should never be hardcoded), and data storage. This conceptual separation leads to cleaner, more maintainable projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "While `Git` is designed for source code management, file storage requires dedicated solutions. Many such tools exist. On SSP Cloud, the recommended option is `MinIO`, an open-source implementation of the `S3` storage protocol introduced earlier. This brief tutorial will walk you through a standard workflow for using `MinIO` in your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Warning**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> No matter which storage solution you use for your data or models, \\*\\*you must include the code that generates these objects in your project repository\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4.1 Sharing files on SSP Cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, files are stored on `S3` in a bucket. On SSP Cloud, a bucket is automatically created when your account is set up, and it has the same name as your SSP Cloud username. The [My Files](https://datalab.sspcloud.fr/my-files) interface allows you to access it visually, upload files, download them, and more.\n",
    "\n",
