    "\n",
    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The [introductory chapter to `Pandas`](../../content/manipulation/02_pandas_intro.qmd) presented the concept of data organized in the form of a *DataFrame* and the practicality of the `Pandas` ecosystem for performing simple operations on a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is rare to work exclusively on a raw source. A dataset generally gains value when compared to other sources. For researchers, this allows contextualizing the information present in one source by comparing or associating it with other sources. For data scientists in the private sector, it often involves linking information about the same person in multiple customer databases or comparing customers with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the benefits of modern data science tools, especially `Pandas`, is the ease with which they allow restructuring sources to work on multiple datasets in a project. This chapter consolidates the principles previously seen by refining the data processing. It will mainly explore two types of operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Group descriptive statistics;\n",
    "-   Data merging by common characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performing this work simply, reliably, and efficiently is essential for data scientists as this task is common. Fortunately, `Pandas` handles this very well with structured data. In the following chapters, and also throughout the [section on text data processing](../../content/nlp/index.qmd), we will see how to handle less structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this work, we will deepen our understanding of a real world phenomenon through detailed descriptive statistics. This is an essential step before moving on to [inferential statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference), the approach that consists of formalizing and generalizing correlations or causal relationships between observed characteristics and a phenomenon.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **What you will learn in this chapter**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> -   Retrieve an official dataset from Insee;\n",
    "> -   Build group descriptive statistics and switch between data levels;\n",
    "> -   Merge data (*reshape*, *merge*) to add value;\n",
    "> -   Create a beautiful table to communicate descriptive statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous chapter used almost exclusively the `Pandas` library. In this chapter, we will use other packages in addition to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained below, we will use a library called `pynsee` to retrieve Insee data useful for enriching our Ademe dataset. This library is not installed by default in `Python`. Before using it, it is necessary to install it, along with the `great_tables` library that we will see at the end of this chapter:"

    "\n",
    "## 3.1 Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter, we saw how to obtain an aggregated statistic easily with `Pandas`. However, it is common to have data with intermediate analysis strata that are relevant: geographical variables, membership in socio-demographic groups related to recorded characteristics, temporal period indicators, etc. To better understand the structure of the data, data scientists are often led to construct descriptive statistics on sub-groups present in the data. For example, we previously constructed emission statistics at the national level. But what about the emission profiles of different departments? To answer this question, it will be useful to aggregate our data at the departmental level. This will give us different information from the initial dataset (municipal level) and the most aggregated level (national level).\n",
    "\n",
    "In `SQL`, it is very simple to segment data to perform operations on coherent blocks and recollect results in the appropriate dimension. The underlying logic is that of *split-apply-combine*, which is adopted by data manipulation languages, including `pandas` [which is no exception](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/groupby.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following image, from [this site](https://unlhcc.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/16-plyr/), well represents how the `split`-`apply`-`combine` approach works:\n",

    "\n",
    "In `Pandas`, we use `groupby` to segment the data according to one or more axes (this [tutorial](https://realpython.com/pandas-groupby/) on the subject is particularly useful). All the aggregation operations (counting, averages, etc.) that we saw earlier can be applied by group.\n",
    "\n",

    "This ranking may reflect demographics rather than the process we wish to measure. Without the addition of information on the population of each département to control for this factor, it is difficult to know whether there is a structural difference in behavior between the inhabitants of Nord (département 59) and Moselle (département 57).\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of question 2, let’s take the share of emissions from agriculture and the tertiary sector in departmental emissions:\n",

These data can be observations at the same level as the original source. For example, one of the most common merges is associating a customer database with a purchase database to relate purchasing behavior to characteristics that may explain it. Data merges can also occur at different conceptual levels, generally at a more aggregated level to contextualize finer data and compare an observation to measures within a similar group. For instance, we can associate individual travel times and modes with those of the same age group or people living in the same municipality to compare the differences between certain individuals and a similar sociodemographic group.\n",

    "## 5.1 Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will focus on the most favorable case, which is the situation where information allows for an exact match between two databases\\[^fuzzy\\]. It is a daily necessity for data scientists to merge information present in multiple files. For example, in business databases, customer information (address, age, etc.) will be in one file, sales in another, and product characteristics in a third file. To have a complete base that compares all this information, it will be necessary to join these three files based on common information.\n",
    "\n",
    "This practice stems from the fact that many information systems take the form of a star schema:\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "This structuring of information is closely related to the model of relational tables from the 1980s. Today, there are more flexible data models where information is stacked in a data lake without an a priori structure. Nevertheless, this star schema model retains relevance because it allows sharing information only with those who need it, leaving it to those who need to link data to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the logic of the star schema historically comes from relational databases, it is natural that it is an approach intrinsically linked to the philosophy of SQL, even in the vocabulary. The term “data join” is often used, inherited from the SQL `JOIN` term, and the way to describe joins (left join, right join…) comes directly from the associated SQL instructions.\n",

    "### 5.3.2 Sirene: the identifier in business data\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect French business microdata, there is a unique identification number: the [Siren number](https://entreprendre.service-public.fr/vosdroits/F32135). It is an identification number in a legal business directory essential for all legal, fiscal, and other procedures. For companies that have multiple establishments—for example, in several cities—there is a derived identifier called the [Siret](https://www.economie.gouv.fr/cedef/numero-siret): the 9 digits of the Siren number are followed by 5 establishment identification digits. Moreover, public administrations are also concerned with the Siren number: being involved in market operations (purchasing equipment, renting goods, etc.), they also have a Siren identifier. As they are registered in legal directories whose information is public, the Siren numbers and the associated company names are available in open data, for example, on [annuaire-entreprises.data.gouv.fr/](https://annuaire-entreprises.data.gouv.fr/) for occasional searches, or on [data.gouv.fr](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/base-sirene-des-entreprises-et-de-leurs-etablissements-siren-siret/).\n",
    "\n",
    "This Sirene database is a treasure trove of information, sometimes amusing, about French companies. For example, the site [tif.hair/](https://tif.hair/) cataloged the proportion of hair salons with puns in their names. When an entrepreneur declares the creation of a business, they receive a Siren number and an activity code (the [APE code](https://entreprendre.service-public.fr/vosdroits/F33050)) related to the description of their business activity. This code allows the classification of a business activity in the [French Classification of Activities (NAF)](https://www.insee.fr/fr/information/2406147), which will be used by Insee for the publication of sectoral statistics. In the case of hairdressers, the code in the NAF is [96.02A](https://www.insee.fr/fr/metadonnees/nafr2/sousClasse/96.02A?champRecherche=false). From the open data available, it is possible, in a few lines of `Python`, to get the list of all hairdressers and then explore this data (the subject of the next optional exercise).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following optional exercise suggests replicating, in a simplified manner, the survey done by [tif.hair/](https://tif.hair/) on puns in hair salon names. It allows practicing some text manipulation methods, ahead of the chapter dedicated to [regular expressions](../../content/manipulation/04b_regex_TP.qmd).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the dataset of all companies is quite large (around 4GB in CSV after decompression), it is more practical to use a dataset in `Parquet` format, which is more optimized (more details on this format in the [advanced chapter](../../content/modern-ds/s3.qmd) dedicated to it).\n",
    "\n",
    "To read this type of file optimally, it is recommended to use the `DuckDB` library, which allows consuming only the necessary data instead of downloading the entire file to read only a part of it as would be the case with `Pandas` (see the end of this chapter, section “Beyond `Pandas`”). The following SQL query translates into natural language as: *“From the `Parquet` file, I only want a few columns of the file for hairdressers (APE: 96.02A) whose business name (`denominationUsuelleEtablissement`) is provided”*:"

    "There is a before and after `Pandas` in data analysis with `Python`. Without this incredibly practical package, Python, despite all its strengths, would have struggled to establish itself in the data analysis landscape. However, while `Pandas` offers a coherent syntax in many aspects, it is not perfect either. More recent data analysis paradigms in `Python` sometimes aim to correct these syntactical imperfections.\n",

    "Among the most annoying points in everyday use is the need to regularly perform `reset_index` when building descriptive statistics. Indeed, it can be dangerous to keep indices that are not well controlled because, if we are not careful during the merge phases, they can be misused by `Pandas` to join data, leading to surprises.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Pandas` is extremely well-designed for restructuring data from long to wide format or vice versa. However, this is not the only way to restructure a dataset that we might want to implement. It often happens that we want to compare the value of an observation to that of a group to which it belongs. This is particularly useful in anomaly analysis, outlier detection, or fraud investigation. Natively, in `Pandas`, you need to build an aggregate statistic by group and then merge it back to the initial data using the group variable. This is somewhat tedious:"

    "# 8. Other paradigms\n",
    "\n",
    "These two chapters have explored in depth the richness of the `Pandas` ecosystem, which is indispensable in the data scientist’s toolbox. Despite all the limitations we have mentioned, and the alternative solutions we will present, `Pandas` remains the central package of the data ecosystem with `Python`. In the following chapters, we will see its native integration with the `Scikit` ecosystem for machine learning or the extension of `Pandas` to spatial data with `GeoPandas`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other technical solutions that we will discuss here may be relevant if you want to handle large volumes of data or if you want to use alternative syntaxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main alternatives to `Pandas` are [`Polars`](https://pola.rs/), [`DuckDB`](https://duckdb.org/), and [`Spark`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/index.html). There is also [`Dask`](https://www.dask.org/), a library for parallelizing `Pandas` operations.\n",

    "## 8.1 `Polars`\n",
    "\n",
    "`Polars` is certainly the paradigm most inspired by `Pandas`, even in the choice of name. The first fundamental difference lies in the internal layers used. `Polars` relies on the `Rust` implementation of `Arrow`, whereas `Pandas` relies on `Numpy`, which results in performance loss. This allows `Polars` to be more efficient on large volumes of data, especially since many operations are parallelized and rely on lazy evaluation, a programming principle that optimizes queries for logical rather than defined execution order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another strength of `Polars` is its more coherent syntax, benefiting from over fifteen years of `Pandas` existence and almost a decade of `dplyr` (the data manipulation package within the `R` tidyverse paradigm). To take the previous example, there is no longer a need to force the reference to the DataFrame; in an execution chain, all subsequent references will be made with respect to the initial DataFrame.\n",

    "Besides its great efficiency, as `DuckDB` can handle data volumes larger than the computer or server’s RAM, it offers the advantage of a uniform syntax across languages that call `DuckDB` (`Python`, `R`, `C++`, or `Javascript`). `DuckDB` favors SQL syntax for data processing with many pre-implemented functions to simplify certain data transformations (e.g., for [text data](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/functions/char.html), [time data](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/functions/time), etc.).\n",

This paradigm is built on the idea that `Python` users access it via clusters with many nodes to process data in parallel. The data will be read in blocks, processed in parallel depending on the number of parallel nodes. The `Spark` DataFrame API has a syntax close to previous paradigms with more complex engineering in the background related to native parallelization."
