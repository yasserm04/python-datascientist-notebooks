    "# 1. Introduction: What is an API?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapters, we saw how to consume data from a file (the simplest access mode) or how to retrieve data through web scraping, a method that allows `Python` to mimic the behavior of a web browser and extract information by harvesting the HTML that a website serves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping is a makeshift approach to accessing data. Fortunately, there are other ways to access data: data APIs. In computing, an API is a set of protocols that enables two software systems to communicate with each other. For example, the term “Pandas API” is sometimes used to indicate that `Pandas` serves as an interface between your `Python` code and a more efficient compiled language (`C`) that performs the calculations you request at the Python level. The goal of an API is to provide a simple access point to a functionality while hiding the implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we focus mainly on data APIs. They are simply a way to make data available: rather than allowing the user direct access to databases (often large and complex), the API invites them to formulate a query which is processed by the server hosting the database, and then returns data in response to that query.\n",
    "\n",
    "The increased use of APIs in the context of open data strategies is one of the pillars of the 15 French ministerial roadmaps regarding the opening, circulation, and valorization of public data.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In recent years, an official geocoding service has been established for French territory. It is free and efficiently allows addresses to be geocoded via an API. This API, known as the **National Address Database (BAN)**, has benefited from the pooling of data from various stakeholders (local authorities, postal services, IGN) as well as the expertise of contributors like Etalab. Its documentation is available at <https://api.gouv.fr/les-api/base-adresse-nationale>.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common example used to illustrate APIs is that of a restaurant. The documentation is like your menu: it lists the dishes (databases) that you can order and any optional ingredients you can choose (the parameters of your query): chicken, beef, or a vegetarian option? When you order, you don’t get to see the recipe used in the kitchen to prepare your dish – you simply receive the finished product. Naturally, the more refined the dish you request (i.e. involving complex calculations on the server side), the longer it will take to arrive.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Illustration with the BAN API**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> To illustrate this, let’s imagine what happens when, later in the chapter, we make requests to the BAN API.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Using `Python`, we send our order to the API: addresses that are more or less complete, along with additional instructions such as the municipality code. These extra details are akin to information provided to a restaurant’s server—like dietary restrictions—which personalize the recipe.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Based on these instructions, the dish is prepared. Specifically, a routine is executed on Etalab’s servers that searches an address repository for the one most similar to the address requested, possibly adapting based on the additional details provided. Once the kitchen has completed this preparation, the dish is sent back to the client. In this case, the “dish” consists of geographic coordinates corresponding to the best matching address.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Thus, the client only needs to focus on submitting a proper query and enjoying the dish delivered. The complexity of the process is handled by the specialists who designed the API. Perhaps other specialists, such as those at Google Maps, implement a different recipe for the same dish (geographic coordinates), but they will likely offer a very similar menu. This greatly simplifies your work: you only need to change a few lines of API call code rather than overhauling a long and complex set of address identification methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pedagogical Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "After an initial presentation of the general principle of APIs, this chapter illustrates their use through `Python` via a fairly standard use case: we have a dataset that we first want to geolocate. To do this, we will ask an API to return geographic coordinates based on addresses. Later, we will retrieve somewhat more complex information through other APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. First Use of APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "An API is intended to serve as an intermediary between a client and a server. This client can be of two types: a web interface or programming software. The API makes no assumptions about the tool sending it a command; it simply requires adherence to a standard (usually an HTTP request), a query structure (the arguments), and then awaits the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 Understanding the Principle with an Interactive Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The first mode (access via a browser) is primarily used when a web interface allows a user to make choices in order to return results corresponding to those selections. Let’s revisit the example of the geolocation API that we will use in this chapter. Imagine a web interface that offers the user two choices: a postal code and an address. These inputs will be injected into the query, and the server will respond with the appropriate geolocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Important**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> An interactive explanation is available on [the course website](https://pythonds.linogaliana.fr/content/manipulation/04c_API_TP.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 How to Do It with `Python`?\n",
    "\n",
    "The principle is the same, although we lose the interactive aspect. With `Python`, the idea is to construct the desired URL and fetch the result through an HTTP request.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already seen in the web scraping chapter how `Python` communicates with the internet via the `requests` package. This package follows the HTTP protocol where two main types of requests can be found: `GET` and `POST`:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The `GET` request is used to retrieve data from a web server. It is the simplest and most common method for accessing the resources on a web page. We will start by describing this one.\n",
    "-   The `POST` request is used to send data to the server, often with the goal of creating or updating a resource. On web pages, it is commonly used for submitting forms that need to update information in a database (passwords, customer data, etc.). We will see its usefulness later, when we begin to deal with authenticated requests where additional information must be submitted with our query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s conduct a first test with `Python` as if we were already familiar with this API."

    "## 2.3 How to Know the *Inputs* and *Outputs* of APIs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we took the BAN API as a magical tool whose main *inputs* (the endpoint, parameters, and their formatting…) were known.\n",
    "But how does one actually get there in practice? Simply by reading the documentation when it exists and testing it with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good APIs provide an interactive tool called [`swagger`](https://swagger.io/docs/). It is an interactive website where the API’s main features are described and where the user can interactively test examples. These documentations are often automatically created during the construction of an API and made available via an entry point `/docs`. They often allow you to edit certain parameters in the browser, view the obtained JSON (or the generated error), and retrieve the formatted query that produced it. These interactive browser consoles replicate the experimentation that can otherwise be done using specialized tools like [`postman`](https://www.postman.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the BAN API, the documentation can be found at <https://adresse.data.gouv.fr/api-doc/adresse>. Unfortunately, it is not interactive. However, it provides many examples that can be directly tested from the browser. You simply need to use the URLs provided as examples. These are presented using `curl` (a command-line equivalent of `requests` in Linux):\n",

    "> **Some APIs to Know**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The main providers of official data offer APIs. This is notably the case for [Insee](https://api.insee.fr/catalogue/), [Eurostat](https://wikis.ec.europa.eu/display/EUROSTATHELP/API+-+Getting+started), the [ECB](https://data.ecb.europa.eu/help/data-examples), [FED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/), and the [World Bank](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/topics/125589)…\n",
    ">\n",
    "> However, data production by state institutions is far from limited to public statistics producers. The [API gouv](https://api.gouv.fr/) portal serves as the main reference point for APIs produced by the French central administration or territorial authorities. Many cities also publish data about their infrastructures via APIs, for example the [City of Paris](https://opendata.paris.fr/api/explore/v2.1/console).\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Private data providers also offer APIs. For instance, [SNCF](https://data.sncf.com/api) or [RATP](https://data.ratp.fr/pages/temps-reel/) provide APIs for various purposes. Major digital players, such as [`Spotify` ](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/), generally offer APIs to integrate some of their services into external applications.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> That said, it is important to be aware of the limitations of certain APIs. First, the data shared may not be very detailed so as not to compromise the confidentiality of the users’ information or the market share of the provider, which may have little incentive to share high-value data. Additionally, an API can disappear or change its structure overnight. Since data restructuring code is often closely tied to an API’s structure, you might end up having to modify a significant amount of code if a critical API undergoes a substantial change.\n",

    "# 4. Discovering `POST` Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.1 Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have discussed `GET` requests. Now, we will introduce `POST` requests, which allow for more complex interactions with API servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore this, we will revisit the previous geolocation API but use a different endpoint that requires a `POST` request.\n",
    "\n",
    "`POST` requests are typically used when specific data needs to be sent to trigger an action. For instance, in the web world, if authentication is required, a `POST` request can send a token to the server, which will respond by accepting your authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we will send data to the server, which will process it for geolocation and then send us a response. To continue the culinary metaphor, it’s like handing over your own container (*tupperware*) to the kitchen to collect your takeaway meal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.2 Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at this request provided on the geolocation API’s documentation site:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "curl -X POST -F data=@path/to/file.csv -F columns=voie -F columns=ville -F citycode=ma_colonne_code_insee https://api-adresse.data.gouv.fr/search/csv/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, `curl` is a command-line tool for making API requests. The `-X POST` option clearly indicates that we want to make a `POST` request.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other arguments are passed using the `-F` options. In this case, we are sending a file and adding parameters to help the server locate the data inside it. The `@` symbol indicates that `file.csv` should be read from the disk and sent in the request body as form data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.3 Application with `Python`\n",
    "\n",
    "We have `requests.get`, so naturally, we also have `requests.post`. This time, parameters must be passed to our request as a dictionary, where the keys are argument names and the values are `Python` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main challenge, illustrated in the next exercise, lies in passing the `data` argument: the file must be sent as a `Python` object using the `open` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Exercise 3: A `POST` request to geolocate our data in bulk**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 1.  Save the `adresse`, `DEPCOM`, and `Nom_commune` columns of the equipment database merged with our previous directory (object `bpe_enriched`) in CSV format. Before writing to CSV, it may be helpful to replace commas in the `adresse` column with spaces.\n",
    "> 2.  Create the `response` object using `requests.post` with the correct arguments to geocode your CSV.\n",
    "> 3.  Transform your output into a `geopandas` object using the following command:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ``` python\n",
    "> bpe_loc = pd.read_csv(io.StringIO(response.text))\n",

    "We have already used several APIs. However, these APIs were all without authentication and had few restrictions, except for the number of calls. This is not the case for all APIs. It is common for APIs that allow access to more data or confidential information to require authentication to track data users.\n",
    "\n",

    "Tokens are personal information that should not be shared. They are not meant to be present in the code.

    "-   For interactive code (e.g., via a *notebook*), it is possible to create a dialog box that injects the provided value into a variable. This can be done using the `getpass` package.\n",
