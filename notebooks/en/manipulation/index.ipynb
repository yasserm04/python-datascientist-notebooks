    "Although data scientists are often associated with the implementation\n",
    "of artificial intelligence models, it is important\n",
    "not to forget that training and using\n",
    "these models do not necessarily represent\n",
    "the daily work of data scientists.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice,\n",
    "gathering heterogeneous data sources, structuring\n",
    "and harmonizing them for exploratory analysis\n",
    "prior to modeling or visualization\n",
    "represents a significant part of data scientists’ work.\n",
    "In many environments, this is even the essence of a data scientist’s role.\n",
    "Developing relevant models indeed requires deep reflection on the data;\n",
    "an essential step that should not be overlooked.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course,\n",
    "like many introductory resources on\n",
    "data science (Wickham, Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Grolemund 2023; VanderPlas 2016; McKinney 2012),\n",
    "will therefore offer a lot of content on data manipulation, an\n",
    "essential skill for data scientists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming software\n",
    "based around the database concept\n",
    "has become the main tool for data scientists.\n",
    "Being able to apply a number of standard operations\n",
    "on databases, regardless of their nature,\n",
    "allows programmers to be more efficient than if they had to\n",
    "repeat these operations manually, as in Excel.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the dominant programming languages in the data science ecosystem\n",
    "are based on the dataframe principle.\n",
    "It is even a central object in some software,\n",
    "notably R.\n",
    "The logic of [`SQL`](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_Query_Language),\n",
    "a language for declaring data operations that has been around for over fifty years,\n",
    "provides a relevant framework for performing standardized operations\n",
    "on columns (creating new columns, selecting subsets of rows, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the dataframe only recently became established in Python,\n",
    "thanks to the `Pandas` package created\n",
    "by [Wes McKinney](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_McKinney).\n",
    "The rise of the `Pandas` library (downloaded over 5 million times\n",
    "per day in 2023) is largely responsible for Python’s success\n",
    "in the data science ecosystem and has led, in just a few years,\n",
    "to a complete renewal of how coding in Python, such\n",
    "a flexible language, is approached for data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This part of the course is a general introduction\n",
    "to the rich ecosystem of\n",
    "data manipulation with Python.\n",
    "These chapters cover both data retrieval\n",
    "and the restructuring and analysis\n",
    "of that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of that section\n",
    "\n",
    "`Pandas` has become essential in the `Python` ecosystem for *data science*.\n",
    "`Pandas` itself is built on top of the `Numpy` package, which is useful to understand\n",
    "to be comfortable with `Pandas`. `Numpy` is a low-level library\n",
    "for storing and manipulating data.\n",
    "`Numpy` is at the heart of the *data science* ecosystem because most libraries, even those\n",
    "handling unstructured objects,\n",
    "use objects built from `Numpy`[1].\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Pandas` approach, which provides a unified entry point for manipulating\n",
    "datasets of very different natures,\n",
    "has been extended to geographic objects with `Geopandas`.\n",
    "This allows for the manipulation of geographic data as if\n",
    "it were classic structured data. Geographic data and\n",
    "cartographic representation are becoming increasingly common with\n",
    "the rise of open localized data and geolocated *big-data*.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, structured data imported from flat files\n",
    "is not the only data source. APIs and *web scraping*\n",
    "allow for flexible downloading or extraction\n",
    "of data from web pages or specialized portals. These data, particularly\n",
    "those obtained through *web scraping*, often require a bit more data\n",
    "cleaning work, especially with character strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Pandas` ecosystem thus represents a Swiss army knife\n",
    "for data analysis. This is why this course\n",
    "will cover it extensively.\n",
    "Before trying to implement an *ad hoc* solution, it is\n",
    "often useful to ask the following question: *“Could I do this\n",
    "with the basic functionalities of `Pandas`?”* Asking this question can\n",
    "prevent arduous paths and save a lot of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, `Pandas` is not\n",
    "suitable for handling large volumes of data.\n",
    "To process such\n",
    "data, it is recommended to use `Polars` or `Dask`, which adopt the logic of `Pandas` but\n",
    "optimize its functionality, `Spark` if you have suitable infrastructure, generally in\n",
    "big data environments, or\n",
    "`DuckDB` if you are willing to use SQL queries rather than a high-level library.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "This section provides both detailed tutorials\n",
    "and guided exercises. You can view them on this site or use one of the\n",
    "badges at the beginning of the chapter, for example\n",
    "these to open the [Pandas exercises chapter](../../content/manipulation/02_pandas_intro.qmd):\n",

    "\n",
    "This course does not really address issues of volume or speed of\n",

    "`Pandas` can show its limits in this area with large datasets\n",

    "-   The *packages* [`Dask`](https://dask.org/) or [`Polars`](https://ssphub.netlify.app/post/polars/) to speed up computations;\n",
    "-   [`DuckDB`](https://duckdb.org/docs/api/python/overview.html) for very efficient SQL queries;\n",
    "-   [`PySpark`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/index.html) for very large datasets.\n",
