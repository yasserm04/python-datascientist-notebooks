    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Pandas` package has been the central piece of the data science ecosystem for about a decade. The *DataFrame*, a central object in languages like `R` or `Stata`, had long been absent in the `Python` ecosystem. Yet, thanks to `Numpy`, all the basic components were present but needed to be reconfigured to meet the needs of data scientists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wes McKinney, when he built `Pandas` to provide a dataframe leveraging the numerical computation library `Numpy` in the background, enabled a significant leap forward for `Python` in data analysis, explaining its popularity in the data science ecosystem. `Pandas` is not without limitations[1], which we will have the opportunity to discuss, but the vast array of analysis methods it offers greatly simplifies data analysis work. For more information on this package, the reference book by McKinney (2012) presents many of the package’s features.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will focus on the most relevant elements in the context of an introduction to data science, leaving interested users to deepen their knowledge with the abundant resources available on the subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "As datasets generally gain value by associating multiple sources, for example, to relate a record to contextual data or to link two client databases to obtain meaningful data, the next chapter will present how to merge different datasets with `Pandas`. By the end of the next chapter, thanks to data merging, we will have a detailed database on the carbon footprints of the French[2].\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Data used in this chapter\n",
    "\n",
    "In this `Pandas` tutorial, we will use:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Greenhouse gas emissions estimated at the municipal level by ADEME. The dataset is available on [data.gouv](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/inventaire-de-gaz-a-effet-de-serre-territorialise/#_) and can be queried directly in `Python` with [this URL](https://koumoul.com/s/data-fair/api/v1/datasets/igt-pouvoir-de-rechauffement-global/convert).\n",
    "\n",
    "The [next chapter](../../content/manipulation/02_pandas_suite.qmd) will allow us to apply the elements presented in this chapter with the above data combined with contextual data at the municipal level.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "We will follow the usual conventions in importing packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "[1] The equivalent ecosystem in `R`, the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/), developed by *Posit*, is of more recent design than `Pandas`. Its philosophy could thus draw inspiration from `Pandas` while addressing some limitations of the `Pandas` syntax. Since both syntaxes are an implementation in `Python` or `R` of the `SQL` philosophy, it is natural that they resemble each other and that it is pertinent for data scientists to know both languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "[2] Actually, it is not the carbon footprint but the **national inventory** since the database corresponds to a production view, not consumption. Emissions made in one municipality to satisfy the consumption of another will be attributed to the former where the carbon footprint concept would attribute it to the latter. Moreover, the emissions presented here do not include those produced by goods made abroad. This exercise is not about constructing a reliable statistic but rather understanding the logic of data merging to construct descriptive statistics."

    "## 2.2 Before seeing `DataFrame`, we need to know `Pandas` `Series`\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, a *DataFrame* is a collection of objects called `pandas.Series`. These `Series` are one-dimensional objects that are extensions of the one-dimensional `Numpy` arrays[1]. In particular, to facilitate the handling of categorical or temporal data, additional variable types are available in `Pandas` compared to `Numpy` (`categorical`, `datetime64`, and `timedelta64`). These types are associated with optimized methods to facilitate the processing of this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several possible types for a `pandas.Series`, extending the basic data types in `Python`, which will determine the behavior of this variable. Indeed, many operations do not have the same meaning depending on whether the value is numeric or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest types (`int` or `float`) correspond to numeric values:\n",
    "\n",
    "[1] The original goal of `Pandas` is to provide a high-level library for more abstract low-level layers, such as `Numpy` arrays. `Pandas` is gradually changing these low-level layers to favor `Arrow` over `Numpy` without destabilizing the high-level commands familiar to `Pandas` users. This shift is due to the fact that `Arrow`, a low-level computation library, is more powerful and flexible than `Numpy`. For example, `Numpy` offers limited textual types, whereas `Arrow` provides greater freedom."

    "\n",
    "-   Each **variable** has its own column;\n",
    "-   Each **observation** has its own row;\n",
    "-   A **value**, representing an observation of a variable, is located in a single cell.\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "These principles may seem like common sense, but you will find that many data formats do not adhere to them. For example, Excel spreadsheets often have values spanning multiple columns or several merged rows. Restructuring this data according to the tidy data principle will be crucial to performing analysis on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Importing Data with `Pandas`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you had to manually create all your DataFrames from vectors, `Pandas` would not be practical. `Pandas` offers many functions to read data stored in different formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest data to read are tabular data stored in an appropriate format. The two main formats to know are `CSV` and `Parquet`. The former has the advantage of simplicity - it is universal, known to all, and readable by any text editor. The latter is gaining popularity in the data ecosystem because it addresses some limitations of CSV (optimized storage, predefined variable types…) but has the disadvantage of not being readable without a suitable tool (which fortunately are increasingly present in standard code editors like `VSCode`). For more information on the difference between `CSV` and `Parquet`, refer to the [deep dive chapters](../../content/modern-ds/s3.qmd) on the subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data stored in other text-derived formats from `CSV` (`.txt`, `.tsv`…) or formats like `JSON` are readable with `Pandas`, but sometimes it takes a bit of iteration to find the correct reading parameters. In other chapters, we will discover that other data formats related to different data structures are also readable with `Python`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flat formats (`.csv`, `.txt`…) and the `Parquet` format are easy to use with `Pandas` because they are not proprietary and they store data in a tidy form. Data from spreadsheets, `Excel` or `LibreOffice`, are more or less complicated to import depending on whether they follow this schema or not. This is because these tools are used indiscriminately. While in the data science world, they should primarily be used to disseminate final tables for reporting, they are often used to disseminate raw data that could be better shared through more suitable channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main difficulties with spreadsheets is that the data are usually associated with documentation in the same tab - for example, the spreadsheet has some lines describing the sources before the table - which requires human intelligence to assist `Pandas` during the import phase. This will always be possible, but when there is an alternative in the form of a flat file, there should be no hesitation.\n",

    "\n",
    "So far, we haven’t discussed what could be a stumbling block for a data scientist: missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real datasets are rarely complete, and missing values can reflect many realities: data retrieval issues, irrelevant variables for a given observation, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, `Pandas` handles missing values without issues (except for `int` variables, but that’s an exception). By default, missing values are displayed as `NaN` and are of type `np.nan` (for temporal values, i.e., of type `datetime64`, missing values are `NaT`). We get consistent aggregation behavior when combining two columns, one of which has missing values."
